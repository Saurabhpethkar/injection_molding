# Shuriken Design and Injection Molding Simulation

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Manufacturing Process 1 class during my master's program. Inspired by the popular anime Naruto, the goal was to design a Shuriken and bring it to life through engineering simulation. The project involved creating a detailed CAD model and conducting injection molding simulations to ensure the design's manufacturability and structural integrity.

## Project Highlights
1. **Design Inspiration:**
   - Inspired by the Shuriken from the anime Naruto, combining aesthetic appeal with engineering precision.
   - Designed to be both visually appealing and structurally sound.

2. **CAD Modeling:**
   - Crafted a detailed 3D model of the Shuriken using SolidWorks.
   - Ensured the design met all required specifications for injection molding.

3. **Injection Molding Simulation:**
   - Transitioned the design to Autodesk Moldflow to conduct injection molding simulations.
   - Focused exclusively on the performance of Generic PP (Polypropylene).

4. **Simulation Results:**
   - Achieved a fill time of 0.06 seconds, indicating a swift and efficient molding process.
   - Recorded an injection pressure of 3.496 MPa, ensuring the material filled the mold adequately.
   - Moldflowâ€™s predictive analytics showed 100% confidence in the fill quality, with even temperature distribution across the part, ensuring uniformity in the final product.

## Technical Skills Enhanced
- **CAD Modeling:**
  - Honed precision in creating detailed and accurate 3D models using SolidWorks.
- **Injection Molding Process:**
  - Mastered the variables that govern the injection molding process, including fill time, injection pressure, and temperature distribution.
- **Material Behavior:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of how materials behave during the injection molding process.
- **Process Optimization:**
  - Learned to fine-tune process parameters to achieve optimal cycle time and part quality.

## Conclusion
This project was a significant step in my journey through the manufacturing realm. It allowed me to combine my passion for design and anime with advanced engineering techniques. The Shuriken model symbolizes both my creative and technical skills, representing a practical masterclass in material behavior, design considerations for manufacturability, and process optimization.
